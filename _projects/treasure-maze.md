Treasure Maze is a multiplayer first-person shooter game. The game is played by 2, 3 or 4 players. The goal is to find the treasure inside the maze and bring it back to your starting point. Be careful, other players can shoot you if you have the treasure.

A basic raycaster is used for rendering. While an UDP server is the best choice, an HTTP server is used.
