description: A 3D clone of the popular 2048 game by Gabriele Cirulli.
---

This project is meant to be a 3D clone of the popular [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game by Gabriele Cirulli.

[Try it!](https://blodangan.github.io/2048-3D/)

I made this project when I couldn't find 3D versions of 2048 that convinced me. The goal was to make a real 3D clone, not using 2D planes, with smooth animations.
